==========

Sublimerge is a Sublime Text 2 plugin which allows to diff and merge files DIRECTLY in the editor using graphical interface for that purpose.

Because this is my first Sublime Text 2 plugin and the first Python code I have ever written, probably some things could be done
better. So any feedback is welcome!
